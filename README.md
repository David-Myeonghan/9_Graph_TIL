# Graph

    - A set of values that are related in a pair wise fashion.
    - Each Item = Node(Vertex)
    - Nodes are connected with Edges
    - Great Data Structure to model real world relationships.
    - Represents Internet Network, Facebook uses it.

## Types of Graph

    - Directed (one-way), or Undirected (bi-directional)
        - Useful for traffic flow.
        - Undirected friends on Facebook.
        - Directed Twitter

    - Unweighted, or weighted
        - Values can be applied to various aspects of a graph, not just the nodes.
        - Graphs can have information in the edges and the connections.
        - Such as the most efficient way to visit sites that interest you. Like Google Map.

    - Cyclic, or Acyclie
        - Cyclic: Have vertices connected in a circular fashion, where you can go back to the original place(node).

    - i.e. "https://internet-map.net/"
